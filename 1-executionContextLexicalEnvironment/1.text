V8 Engine:
uses both Compiler and Interpreter (JIT, just in time) engine.

syntax parsers:
a program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.

your code => (compiler | syntax parsers) => computer instructions


lexical environments:
where something sits physically in the code you write. 'Lexical' means having to do with
grammar or words. a lexical environment exists in programming languages which, WHERE you write
something is important.

if the variable is written inside function => it is only visible inside that function not globally


execution contexts:
a wrapper to help manage the code that is running. there lots of lexical environments. which one is
currently running is managed via execution contexts. it can contain things beyond what you have written
in your code.

name/value pair:
a name which maps to a unique value, the name may be defined more than once, but only can have one
value in any given CONTEXT. that value may be more name/value pairs.

Address = '100 Main St.'


Object:
a collection of name/value pairs => the simplest definition when talking about JavaScript.
objects can nest other objects in JavaScript.

{ name: { name: {name: value, name: value } }, name: value }
{ Address: { street: 'main', number: 100, apartment: { floor: 3, number: 301 } } }


Global Object:
the "base execution context" in JavaScript is "Global context".
the global execution context creates "Global Object" and a variable called "this" by default.

window => this

at base global level : window === this  => true
in JavaScript global means Not inside a function.

the execution context: 'Creation' and 'Hoisting'
1: creation phase => global object + this + outer environment => sets up memory space for => execution of code line by line
                                                                 variables and functions,
                                                                 so they are available in memory
                                                                 "Hoisting"

Hoisting:
in Hoisting phase the whole function is put into memory, but for variables only name of it is saved in memory,
it gives is a placeholder, called 'undefined' which means it is a value that was initially set by JavaScript

** 'let' and 'const' are NOT hoisted.

2:execution phase: runs your code line by line from top to bottom


Single Threaded, Synchronous Execution:

Single Threaded => One command is being executed at a time
Synchronous => executing one at a time and in order

JavaScript behaves in a single-threaded and synchronous manner.


Function Invocation:
running a function, calling a function by using ()

Execution Stack:
list of commands to be run on top of each other, which ever is currently on top now, will be run next.

Variable Environment:
where the variables live and how they relate to each other in memory.
value of a variable changes based on the location it's defined (it's scope)

Scope:
where a variable is available in your code and if its truly the same variable or a new copy

Scope Chain:
local Scope (if there is local variable defined) ==> outer environment (outside the function scope, if local is not available)


"let" keyword:
"block scoping"
variables defined by let are defined inside a block {}
these variables can't be called before they are executed, even though they are saved inside memory


Asynchronous:
more than one at a time

Asynchronous Callback:
when you set a code and the other part of code (Callback) runs when the process is finished

the browser:
Rending Engine <==> JavaScript Engine <==> Http Requests

when the execution stack becomes empty JavaScript starts to process the Event Queue (which is a list of all the events that happen inside a browser: i.e: click, blur, http request,...)
the event gets processed if we have a function that is defined for handling such event (i.e: clickHandler())


WebAssembly:
the JavaScript compiles down to WA, to run the code in the browser.
WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment
on the web for client and server applications.


Context vs Scope:
Scope is a function based thing, means what is the variable access of a function.
Context is object based, what is value of 'this', related to object that called it.
