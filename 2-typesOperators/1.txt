JavaScript Types

Dynamic Typing:
you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running
it's all figured out while your code is running.
variables can hold different types of values because its all figured out during execution.


Primitive Types:
a Primitive type is a type of data that represents a single value, which means it is NOT an object.


undefined : represents a lack of value on a variable
null: an empty variable
Boolean: true/false
number: in JavaScript the float and integer values both are of type Number (by default a floating point number)
string: sequence of character, both '' and "" acceptable
symbol: used only in ES6

array: arrays in JavaScript are objects

Operators:
a special function that is syntactically (written) differently compared to other functions.
generally, operators take two parameters and return one result.

operator precedence:
which operator function gets called first, functions are called in order of precedence

associativity:
what order operator functions get called in:
left-to-right or right-to-left

Coercion:
converting a value from one type to another. this happens often in JavaScript because its dynamically typed.
when string is added to a numerical type, the numeric is converted to string
1+'2' => '1'+'2' => '12'

use === instead of == to prevent type Coercion
